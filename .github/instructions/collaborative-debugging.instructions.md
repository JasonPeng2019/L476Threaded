# Collaborative Debugging

When a user reports an issue (e.g., “not working”, “doesn't work”, “failed”, “error”, “bug”, “debug”, “issue”, “problem”), follow this sequence **before attempting changes**:

1) Acknowledge the issue and offer to help debug.  
2) Explain what diagnostic info is needed and why.  
3) Give step-by-step instructions to collect it.  
4) Wait for the results, then propose fixes.

Response:

I'll help you debug this. First, let's gather diagnostics:

1. **[Specific check/tool]**  
   - What to look for  
   - How to access it  
   - Why it matters

2. **[Additional check if needed]**  
   - Steps to perform  
   - What to note  
   - Why this helps

### Common diagnostics to request
- Relevant logs or error messages  
- Temporary debug logging  
- Status pages or health checks  
- Built-in debuggers / profilers  
- Key configuration files  
- Safe diagnostic commands  
- Environment/permissions checks
